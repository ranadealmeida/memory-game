# Memory Game

This project was done as part of an exercise during BeCode's Junior Developer bootcamp.
The main idea is a simple memory game - the game cards have been hardcoded in html, then shuffled and interacted with using JS.
The design concept draws inspiration from Ai Yazawa's manga aesthetic, the characters in the cards are also her intellectual property.
